GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE:
    An open-source software license that makes the software free to use and open to anyone. It emphasises collaboration by 
    requiring software to be distributed with the source code, but also works on a large scale by requiring derivatives of 
    the software to comply with the license and also allows commercial distribution. It seems to be a simple, anyone-can-use
    license that just makes sure any derivations are also equally open. I did not choose this license not because it had any 
    flaws, but felt more complicated with more strings-attached than the other two licenses (even though those strings are 
    just making sure the software remains open to all).

Apache License, Version 2.0:
    An open-source software license that appears to give the out the software freely as long as derivations of the software 
    adhere to specified constaints such as including this license file themselve. It seems to be more of a "use at your own
    risk" than the GNU GPL license, giving the software "as-is" and declaring derivations as separate from the original work. 
    I did not choose this license not because I saw any problems with it, but it felt more undeveloped than the MIT License 
    and with more complicated terms than the MIT License.

The MIT License:
    An open-source software license that appears to give out the software freely and with full rights to anyone who receives 
    it in the first place. They must include the original license and the software is received "as-is". I chose this license 
    because it felt the most straight to the point license, incorporating aspects of the other two licenses but also making it 
    a simple transaction of a product.
